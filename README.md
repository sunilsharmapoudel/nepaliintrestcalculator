## My Process

### Built With

- **React** for building the user interface and managing component states
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern styling
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for backend API creation
- **RESTful API** to handle calculations and serve data dynamically

## What I Learned

- **Frontend Development**: Leveraged React with Tailwind CSS to create a user-friendly, responsive interface that is simple yet effective.
- **State Management**: Managed complex user inputs and display elements with React states to ensure accurate and responsive calculations.
- **Backend API**: Designed RESTful endpoints using Express to handle interest calculation logic and support frontend requests.
- **Modular Codebase**: Organized project files to separate concerns, allowing easy maintenance and future expansion.
- **Form Handling and Validation**: Implemented intuitive input fields and real-time validations for accurate user inputs.
